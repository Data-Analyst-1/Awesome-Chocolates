### Project Overview 
This is a Power BI project on Awesome Chocolates analyzing key performance indicators such as the total sales, shipments, and best-performing products and sales-persons.

### Data Sources
The project entailed four dimension tables and one fact table. These are:
- Locations
- People
- Products
- Shipments
- Calendar Table

### Tools Used
- MS Excel – Data Cleaning 
- Power BI – Data Analysis and Visualization

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial stages of data cleaning and preparation, the following tasks were performed:
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values 
- Data modeling where a star schema was created linking the four dimension tables to the fact table.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
These questions were explored in detail:
- What is the total revenue from all the sales made?
- How many boxes have been shipped by the company?
- Which is the best-performing product as well as best performing sales person?

### Data Analysis Results
- Overall, the company met its profit target of 60%, with a total revenue of $34 M and a profit of $21M. 
- The best-performing product was Peanut Butter Cubes while the least-performing was Baker’s Choco Chips.
- The company exceeded the LBS target (10%) by having an LBS of 10.21%.

### Recommendations 
1. Invest in marketing and promotion of the top-performing products.
2. Review the non-performing products and consider a value addition program for products showing potential.
3. Consider reducing the LBS orders since they add to the shipment costs while not adding to the overall profits.
